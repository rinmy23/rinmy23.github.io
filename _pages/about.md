Hi! I am Maolin He. I am a IT master student at CIS Department of The University of Melbourne, supervised by [A/Prof Brian Chapman](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/869156-brian-chapman).

My primary research interests are centered around NLP. My research is motivated by the ultimate goal of enhancing information access for newcomers in knowledge-intensive domain. Using, understanding, and improving information retrieval (IR) and large language models (LLMs) can provide us with powerful tools to enhance our research. Recently, I have been concentrating on enhancing information access for cancer patients using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

**Developing Optimal Grounding Resources for Consumer QA Systems** - Advanced RAG systems capable of retrieving reliable information (PubMed Abstract and PMC Review) and using appropriate text segmentation approach are crucial for retrieval module of RAG system.

**Creating a Cancer Patient-facing QA System using LLMs** - It is crucial to enhance response reliability, understandability and verifiability for users (cancer patient) from diverse educational backgrounds, particularly those who are newcomer in medical domain. My emphasis is on developing sophisticated systems capable of deciding optimal retrieval strategies (no retrieval, single-step retrieval, multi-step retrieval), improving response understandability and verifiability, and using metadata analysis to filter evidence within comprehensive retrieval results.
